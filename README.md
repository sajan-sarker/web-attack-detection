# üö® An Explainable Approach for Network Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network

This repository contains the complete implementation, documentation, and results of our senior design project for CSE499. Our project focuses on developing a machine learning and deep neural network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is not only accurate but also explainable.

## üìå Project Overview
With the growing rate of cyberattacks on web applications, a robust and interpretable IDS is crucial. This project investigates the impact of synthetic data on IDS performance and introduces a framework that combines multiple machine learning models with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for improved accuracy and transparency.

### Key Features
- Utilizes **[CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)**, a comprehensive intrusion detection dataset.
- Applies **SMOTE** for dataset balancing (small, medium, and large variants).
- Employs **XGBoost** for feature selection.
- Implements multiple ML algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, AdaBoost, MLP.
- Constructs a **weighted ensemble model** for robust classification.
- Integrates **SHAP** and **LIME** for explainable predictions.
- Includes **real-world testing** using captured traffic via Wireshark.
